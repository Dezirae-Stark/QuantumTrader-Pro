# CRITICAL: Never commit private keys!
# ONLY public.key should be committed!

# Private key file (various possible names)
private.key
*.private.key
*_private.key
signing.key

# PEM/P8 files (except public.key)
*.pem
*.p8

# Private key backups
*.bak
*.backup

# Encrypted private keys (still shouldn't be committed)
*.encrypted
*.enc

# Key generation artifacts
*.tmp
*.temp

# Allow public.key specifically
!public.key

# Note: The pattern above allows public.key while blocking all other key files
